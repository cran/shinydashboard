shinydashboard 0.4.0.9xxx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Updated to AdminLTE 2.1.2 (406de4e). Please note that some CSS selectors have
  changed, so if you are using custom CSS, it may require modification. The
  documentation at http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/appearance.html has
  some updated examples.

* shinydashboard now respects the `shiny.minified` option.

* Collapse buttons on boxes trigger `shown` and `hidden` events. Previously they
  did not, which resulted in dynamic content not working for boxes that started
  collapsed. (#17, #42)

* Dynamic menuSubItems now work in the sidebar. (#54)

* Arbitrary content may now be used in a `sidebarMenu()`, not just `menuItem`s.
  (#44)

* Added options to set the width of `dashboardHeader()` and
  `dashboardSidebar()`. (#43, #45, #54)
